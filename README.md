# The official Venerable House Constitution.

Whenever the constitution.tex file is changed, Travis CI will automatically compile the PDF (takes about two minutes) and deploy it to GitHub Releases. It will also commit the file to [the `ruddock/static/constitution/` folder of the RuddockWebsite repo](https://github.com/RuddockHouse/RuddockWebsite/tree/master/ruddock/static/constitution).

**IMPORTANT**: Because changes to the website repository need to be manually pulled down into the production server, any change to the constitution will not be visible until someone SSHs into the server and updates it. See the website repository for instructions.

If you have any questions about this repository, please contact a Ruddock IMSS Representative.
