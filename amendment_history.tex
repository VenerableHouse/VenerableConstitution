%%%%%%%%%% Why this document exists %%%%%%%%%%
% The Amendment History document was created as a result of passage of a constitutional amendment written by Elaine Lowinger to keep track of changes to the constitution and the reasoning behind them: 
%    8.4 Records
%    If a proposed amendment is passed, the Constitution is modified to match the amended language. In addition, the proposal for the amendment shall be added to the “Amendment History” document. This includes the date of the amendment's approval, the proposer of the amendment, the reasoning of the amendment, the unamended language, and the approved amended language. The Amendment History document shall be accessible to all Full Members of the House.
% As a result, this document started with four amendments passed on May 26, 2020 (including the Records Amendment) and retroactively includes amendments passed by January 19, 2019. Amendments are in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest).
% It is the duty of the House Secretary to update the constitution and this Amendment History document.

\section{UCC Transition to ExComm Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 11/16/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Mario Solis and Aaron Zhou
    
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    In this past election, I was inclined to run for an ExComm position like Secretary, Treasurer, or Vice President. I thought that not only was I qualified to run, but I could also provide competition in these uncontested races for the better of the House. However, I was unable to do this without dropping my Alley 1 UCC role due to the clauses below in the Constitution. I did not think that dropping my UCC position and leaving a vacancy in Alley 1 was worth all of the work I’d have to do to run, so I didn’t. I also didn’t think it would look good on my part from the House’s perspective.

    I’m making this proposal to prevent these reasons from being what causes an active UCC from running for an elected position they think they are well-suited for. While UCCs and ExComm members provide relatively separate functions to the House, it could be the case that an active UCC is perfect for an ExComm position, but this clause is the only thing stopping them from running. In my opinion, they should be able to run if they feel they would be a good fit for the job. Nevertheless, this candidate should understand that they would take on the duties of both roles and ensure that they will be able to commit the time for them. As a House, we should trust our UCCs to be capable of judging how much they can commit to the House. Even if people don’t think a particular candidate should take both positions for a term and a half, they can express that opinion through simply voting for a different candidate or NO in the election. If ExComm has this opinion after the candidate has won their election, they wouldn’t reappoint this person as a UCC for the next year.

    To recall an ExComm member, the process must be put to a vote in the whole House, and this vote is organized by the UCC. To recall a UCC, ExComm is in charge of voting for or against the removal. If a UCC is elected to ExComm and there is a recall petition against them for either position, they should not be involved in either the organization by the UCCs or the ExComm vote. This is the reasoning for the last two additions in this amendment.

\section{Amendment Quorum Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 11/16/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Aaron Zhou
    
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    Currently, the 1/3 quorum on amendments runs the risk that any proposed amendment will not be passed simply due to a lack of interest. In the long run, this is detrimental to the ability for the House to drive change within broken systems in the House. As a result, we propose several potential changes to the amendment quorum: a reduction to 1/5 of Full Membership of the House, a reduction to 1/4 of Full Membership of the House, and a complete elimination of the amendment quorum. Under Section 8.2.2 of the Venerable Constitution, these options should all be presented to the House and the most favored option should be implemented.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:}
        
        8.2 Necessary Vote

        1. In the case of non-conflicting amendments, an amendment to this Constitution passes if at least 2/3 of the votes cast are in favor of the amendment, when quorum is established as per Section 5.2.

        B Mural Amendment
        
        The President will distribute the submitted material to Full Members. In the 48 hours following distribution of the Proposal, comments (including major grievances) are gathered from Full Members. The comments shall be posted immediately following this period. A 72-hour voting period ensues, after which the mural receives House Approval if it receives a 2/3 majority of non-abstain votes with at least 50\% of the members present voting ``Yes'', when those voting constitute at least 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House.

    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:}

        8.2 Necessary Vote

        1. In the case of non-conflicting amendments, an amendment to this Constitution passes if at least 2/3 of the votes cast are in favor of the amendment, \swap{when quorum is established as per Section 5.2}{where quorum is established with 1/4 of Full Membership of the House}.

\section{Social Quorum Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/7/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Recently, it has taken extended periods of time to hit the 1/3 quorum requirement on membership meetings after dinner. Low attendance meetings have primarily reached quorum through waiting for proxy votes, rather than an increase of in-person meeting attendance. By lowering the quorum requirement to 1/4, this would reduce the average waiting period before meetings without significant consequences to how representative the vote is of the house.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        5.2 Quorum \\
        1. A quorum shall consist of:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
        5.2 Quorum \\

            \item[\textcolor{red}{(a)} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{(b)}] 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House \textcolor{ForestGreen}{for all other House Meetings}.

\section{Membership Application Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/7/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Joe Giambrone
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} The method of applying for a membership is not currently codified in the constitution. This would align with our current process of having guests announce themselves at dinner, while additionally allowing those who are unwilling or unable to do so to apply through an alternative method. Additionally, this will provide more flexibility with when membership meetings will take place, allowing for a quicker process.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        1.2 Membership \\
        1. The types and qualifications of membership are:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item[(b)] a Social Member, who is an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology and has been voted in as such, following a week of consideration, by a simple majority of non-abstain votes, when quorum is established as per Section 5.2;
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
        1.2 Membership \\
        1. The types and qualifications of membership are:

            \item[(b)] a Social Member, who is an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology and has been voted in as such, \del{following a week of consideration,} by a simple majority of non-abstain votes, when quorum is established as per Section 5.2;
        \end{enumerate}
        \textcolor{ForestGreen}{4. Those seeking a full or social membership shall announce their intent to apply at a House dinner, or, in extenuating circumstances, may send their request to the President and Secretary, who will then announce it to the House Membership. Voting on a new membership application shall take place at a House meeting within the next available calendar week following the application.}

\section{Mural Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/7/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Elin Stenmark
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    There currently exists no constitutional precedent for the process of altering House spaces by painting murals, including who gets to submit a Mural Proposal, how House Approval is sought, and who is deemed responsible for ensuring compliance with Caltech policy and communication with the appropriate stakeholders.

    The Mural process is a cooperative effort between the House and Caltech's Housing Office, and is governed by Caltech policy. Therefore, this amendment seeks to clarify and codify our internal Mural Proposal process while leaving enough flexibility to adapt to new Caltech policy without having to update the constitution in the event that Caltech policy changes.
    
    Any Venerable House member can become a Project Leader, given that Full Members vote on any proposed mural. Quorum and voting seeks to mirror that of House meetings for Full Membership applications.
    
    Given the asynchronous voting period, in the event that a major grievance is identified, by posting the grievances, all members become aware of the alleged issue and are able to vote again with this information in mind. By limiting the instances of voicing grievances to one posting of grievances, we ensure that the proposed mural is not maliciously prevented from being enacted given that it receives enough votes for House Approval. %TODO update probably?

    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        1.3 Duties and Privileges \\
        1. The duties and privileges of Full Members apply immediately upon attaining such status.

        The designated artist lead, hereby ``Project Leader'', is to notify the President of intent to paint a mural. The Project Leader will be asked to submit a Mural Proposal to the President, containing a mockup design and other pertinent details as specified by the President. If policy violations are identified, the Project Leader will be asked to revise their submission. The Diversity Representative shall be consulted to confirm that the mural is absent of offensive depictions.
        
        The President will distribute the submitted material to Full Members. In the 48 hours following distribution of the Proposal, comments (including major grievances) are gathered from Full Members. The comments shall be posted immediately following this period. A 72-hour voting period ensues, after which the mural receives House Approval if it receives a 2/3 majority of non-abstain votes with at least 50\% of the members present voting ``Yes'', when those voting constitute at least 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House.
        
        A Mural Proposal must receive House Approval before being submitted to Caltech's Housing Office. The Project Leader and President jointly assume responsibility for ensuring that the mural complies with all regulations established by Caltech's Housing Office. Further, the President is responsible for submitting the Mural Proposal to Caltech's Housing Office following House Approval.

\section{Election Committee Appointment Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/7/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Joe Giambrone
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Currently, the procedure regarding the actual appointment the Election Committee is not specified. This amendment ensures that it is appointed by the President and the Head Upper Class Committee-member, and clarifies what happens if the President is running.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        A Procedural Amendment \\
        An Election Committee shall be appointed at the nomination meeting. The Election Committee shall be composed of nine Full House Members: 3 sophomores, 3 juniors, and 3 seniors or above, who shall be selected from a pool of volunteers who are not running for an elected office.

\section{Soc/Ath Team Voting Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/24/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    This amendment clarifies how Social and Athletic team elections are run.

    In the past, full members were allowed to run individually or in a team with other members. This caused two issues. First, individuals were put at a disadvantage if they did not have running mates but had to run against a team of candidates. Secondly, there is currently no mathematical method specified as to how a winner is chosen under an election where both individuals and teams can run. This amendment serves to fix both of those problems.

    To standardize all multi-winner election procedures, the upperclass BoC election process has been modified to be in line with the new Social and Athletic team election procedures. The single transferable vote method\footnote{A more detailed explanation can be found here: \href{https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI}{https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI}} (Droop quota variation\footnote{\href{https://youtu.be/wRc630BSTIg}{https://youtu.be/wRc630BSTIg}}) was chosen as it is generally regarded as the most fair multi-winner electoral system and is commonly used in parliamentary elections around the world.
    \item \textbf{Current Language:}
    
    A Procedural Amendment

    Paper ballots shall be cast anonymously at a House Meeting held for that purpose. The Election Committee shall be responsible for collecting and tabulating ballots. The winner of each election, other than for the BoC representatives, shall be determined as follows: all candidates that do not achieve a majority over ``NO'' are eliminated, and the ranked pairs (Tideman) method is applied to the remaining candidates. The Election Committee shall be responsible for breaking any ties that occur during this process.
    
    For the election of the BoC representatives, each voter may cast two first choice votes and rank their replacements in the case that one of their first choices is eliminated. Votes shall be counted via elimination of the candidate with the lowest number of first choice votes until two candidates receive over 1/3 of the votes each.

\section{UCC Eligibility Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/24/2025
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} The constitution currently does not allow transfer students to apply to become UCCs until their second year at Caltech, even if they were to be juniors or seniors during their term in office. This amendment serves to expand UCC application eligibility for that scenario.

\section{Appointed Positions Current Practices Amendment}

    \item \textbf{Author:} Noah Howell and Joe Giambrone

        \item Moved the selection of the Diversity Representative to be during the second round of appointed positions, to keep in line with recent practices.
        \item Updated the role of the Head UCC and Diversity Representative in the selection of appointed positions.
        \item Removed outdated duties of the Historians as they no longer make a scrapbook or maintain a House roll.
        \item Pluralized ``Head Waiters'' as there is more than one of them.
        \item Updated position names of BFD Editors, O'Domhnaills Representatives, IMSS Representatives, BoC Representatives, Head Waiters, and Historians to remove the preceding ``House(-elected)'' or otherwise fix.
        \item Added name and description of the BFD Advisor.
        \item Updated timeline for sign-ups and appointments.
        \item Removed amendment election tabulation from being a UCC responsibility to match recent practices.

\section{Off-Campus Rep Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/2/2024
	\item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} Ever since Bechtel opened in Fall 2018, the importance of the Off-Campus Rep position has significantly reduced. To improve the functionality of Excomm without adjusting its size, this amendment proposes to replace the Off-Campus Rep position with a secondary Soc Man (Social Mini). \\
	Currently, Soc Man is one of the most demanding house positions due to its responsibility of organizing nearly all house events. By adding the Soc Mini position, it would alleviate some of the workload from the Soc Man, while improving continuity in the yearly transition between Social Teams. This Excomm structure of having multiple Social Managers has been well tested in all seven other houses. The current Off-Campus Rep role will be merged with the Soc Mini position, ensuring the voice of off-campus members remains represented on Excomm.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.2.6. The office of Social Team shall be held by not more than five members of the House, among them a single Social Manager. The Social Team will be responsible for organizing social functions, and for publishing a calendar of such events. \\

Nominations shall remain open until 36 hours before the start of the elections as described in section 2.4.2. \\
	2.4.2. Election of all officers except Social Team and Athletic Team shall be carried out at a House Meeting held for that purpose within one week after the nomination meeting.

\section{Food Representative Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The position of Food Representative is not currently in the constitution, this amendment both adds Food Rep to the constitution and makes it a part of the role of being Head Waiter. The Head Waiter is the person best suited to being Food Rep since they are present at most dinners and are best able to judge the house's response to meals.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.3 Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
	5. The Head Waiter shall be responsible for maintaining proper decorum and conduct in the dining room, and shall direct the student waiters.

\section{Election Amendment for Online Voting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} Currently Electcomm uses an online google form for proxy voting. This amendment would align the constitution to the procedure that Electcomm is already using.

\end{itemize}

\section{Election Amendment for Timeline Modifications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} \\
	This amendment fixes outdated language regarding the timing of elections. In the past, each position was nominated and elected before the next position could begin. Since we have moved to electing all positions at the same meeting, this text must also be removed in order to align the constitution to our current procedures. \\
	This amendment also adjusts the timeline for electing Soc Team and Ath Team. This ensures that a Soc Man and Ath Man will have been elected before voting on the team commences. Additionally, it extends the voting period to a week, as has been done in the past 2 years. \\
	This amendment also removes text about requiring a majority of votes since this is conflict with the Procedural Amendment. \\
	The Procedural Amendment also requires that ballots be submitted anonymously, thus it does change the procedure to remove the part about secret ballots.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.3. Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
	5. The Head Waiter shall be responsible for maintaining proper decorum and conduct in the dining room, and shall direct the student waiters.2.4 Nominations, Elections, and Appointments \\
	2. Election of all officers except Social Team and Athletic Team shall be carried out at a House Meeting held for that purpose within one week after the nomination meeting.

The election for each office shall be held before nominations for successive offices are closed. Election shall require a majority of votes cast from the total voting membership, not including blank ballots, and they shall be made by secret ballot. Elections shall be managed by an Election Committee in accordance with the Procedural Amendment. \\
	3. Election for Social Team and Athletic Team shall be carried out through proxy voting beginning at the conclusion of the House Meeting described in section 2.4.2 and concluding 48 hours later. The elections shall be managed by the Election Committee.

\section{Records Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Elaine Lowinger
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} There is no current record of the amendments proposed that have modified the constitution. Therefore, many times when proposing new amendments or trying to determine intent of the constitution, knowledge of this document and the phrasing is lost in time. The goal of this is to log the change in the constitution in an accessible form to the house to understand the changes made. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} None
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{
	8.4 Records \\
	If a proposed amendment is passed, the Constitution is modified to match the amended language. In addition, the proposal for the amendment shall be added to the “Amendment History” document. This includes the date of the amendment's approval, the proposer of the amendment, the reasoning of the amendment, the unamended language, and the approved amended language. The Amendment History document shall be accessible to all Full Members of the House.}
\end{itemize}

\section{IMSS Representative Amendment}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 4/11/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Chase Blanchette
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The duties of the House IMSS reps are currently not codified in the constitution, and no roles for upkeep of specific House technology (3D printer(s), printers) are assigned, which could lead to a lack of accountability. This amendment outline the responsibilities of the IMSS reps and proposes individual roles among the IMSS reps to ensure accountability. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} None
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
	2.3 Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{
	7. The House IMSS Representatives shall act as liaisons between House members and IMSS for network, application, hardware, and software problems. The IMSS Representatives shall include the following: 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item The Lab Rat shall be responsible for the upkeep of computer lab computers, organization of computer lab supplies, and cleaning of the space.
		\item The Printer Representative shall ensure that the House paper-and-ink printers are in working order for use by House members and coordinate with admin for replacement parts and supplies.
		\item The 3D Printer Representative shall ensure that the House 3D printers are in working order for use by House members, procure House-provided 3D printer supplies, and maintain a usage policy for the printer/supplies.
		\item The Webmaster shall be responsible for administration of the Ruddock web server and keeping the website (ruddock.caltech.edu) online.
	\end{enumerate}
	}
	
\end{itemize}




\section{Abstain Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/21/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Elaine Lowinger and Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The current issues with House Memberships, as explained by the UCCs reviewing the constitution, is that there is no distinction between voting No and abstaining from voting, as the wording says “only 2/3 majority of those voting”. To allow a voice to people in the house who would like to be present at meetings and vote, but not comfortable making a firm decision, we want to give them the option to abstain. To do so, we have changed the wording of the constitution. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	1.2 Membership \\
	1. The types and qualifications of membership are: \\
	(a) a Full Member, who is an undergraduate of the California Institute of Technology and is picked as such at the end of Rotation Week, or is elected as such by a 2/3 majority of those voting at a House meeting. 
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
	1.2 Membership \\
	1. The types and qualifications of membership are: \\
	(a) a Full Member, who is an undergraduate of the California Institute of Technology and is picked as such at the end of Rotation Week, or is elected at a House meeting by a 2/3 majority of \textcolor{ForestGreen}{non-abstain votes with at least 50\% of the members present voting “Yes.”}

\section{Room Occupancy Priority Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 3/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Emily Wu
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} Room Hassle and the time leading up to it can be very stressful for Rudds who want to live in the house, especially for those without a position that has a room pick. In order to maximize the number of members that can live in the house and reduce this stress, I am making it explicit that Rudds opting for singles get least priority during Room Hassle, and clarifying some of the other language regarding room occupancy priority.  
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	7.1.4. Rooms, with the exception of a designated sophomore off-campus alley, shall be picked in the following order: 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item by the House President, then 
		\item by all other Full Members in order of 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

\section{Gender Neutral Wording}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Emily Wu and Erik Herrera
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The current version of the constitution uses only ‘He/him/his' pronouns. We would like to use more inclusive language. This would benefit current Ruddock House members and all the classes to come. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} Numerous instances. The change will apply to the entire constitution.
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} Change everywhere the constitution uses male-centered language to gender-neutral language. Examples include \textcolor{red}{he/him/his} to genderless pronouns (\textcolor{ForestGreen}{they/them}) or avoid pronoun use, Committee\textcolor{red}{man} to Committee\textcolor{ForestGreen}{-member}, and fresh\textcolor{red}{man} to \textcolor{ForestGreen}{frosh}.

\section{Splitting Steward Role Between Veep and Treasurer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Rupesh Jeyaram
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:}  As of now, Veep can assume more House responsibilities. The lack of Veep duties results from the Veep/HUCC split two years ago. Treasurer already has a lot of responsibilities, and it would be nice to distribute work more evenly. Makes sense to shift responsibilities in this manner.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.2 Qualifications and Duties of Elected Officers \\
	2. The Vice President shall be a junior or senior for the latter portion of his term in office. He shall assume the duties of the President in the event of the President's absence. He shall be responsible for maintaining the external relations of the House, for bringing guests to the House, and shall act as official host for all House guests. He shall be the Ruddock representative on the Review Committee. \\
	4. The Treasurer shall be responsible to the House for all receipts and expenditures, shall maintain an adequate book-keeping system, shall submit a report to the Executive Committee at each regularly scheduled meeting, shall propose a budget to the Executive Committee for each term, and shall submit to the House a written report of the finances at the end of each term.
