%%%%%%%%%% Why this document exists %%%%%%%%%%
% The Amendment History document was created as a result of passage of a constitutional amendment written by Elaine Lowinger to keep track of changes to the constitution and the reasoning behind them: 
%    8.4 Records
%    If a proposed amendment is passed, the Constitution is modified to match the amended language. In addition, the proposal for the amendment shall be added to the “Amendment History” document. This includes the date of the amendment's approval, the proposer of the amendment, the reasoning of the amendment, the unamended language, and the approved amended language. The Amendment History document shall be accessible to all Full Members of the House.
% As a result, this document started with four amendments passed on May 26, 2020 (including the Records Amendment) and retroactively includes amendments passed by January 19, 2019. Amendments are in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest).
% It is the duty of the House Secretary to update the constitution and this Amendment History document.

\section{Social Quorum Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Recently, it has taken extended periods of time to hit the 1/3 quorum requirement on membership meetings after dinner. Low attendance meetings have primarily reached quorum through waiting for proxy votes, rather than an increase of in-person meeting attendance. By lowering the quorum requirement to 1/4, this would reduce the average waiting period before meetings without significant consequences to how representative the vote is of the house.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        5.2 Quorum \\
        1. A quorum shall consist of:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\

            \item[\textcolor{red}{(a)} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{(b)}] 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House \textcolor{ForestGreen}{for all other House Meetings}.

\section{Membership Application Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Joe Giambrone
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} The method of applying for a membership is not currently codified in the constitution. This would align with our current process of having guests announce themselves at dinner, while additionally allowing those who are unwilling or unable to do so to apply through an alternative method. Additionally, this will provide more flexibility with when membership meetings will take place, allowing for a quicker process.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        1.2 Membership \\
        1. The types and qualifications of membership are:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item[(b)] a Social Member, who is an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology and has been voted in as such, following a week of consideration, by a simple majority of non-abstain votes, when quorum is established as per Section 5.2;
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
        1.2 Membership \\
        1. The types and qualifications of membership are:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item[(b)] a Social Member, who is an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology and has been voted in as such, \del{following a week of consideration,} by a simple majority of non-abstain votes, when quorum is established as per Section 5.2;
        \end{enumerate}
        \textcolor{ForestGreen}{4. Those seeking a full or social membership shall announce their intent to apply at a House dinner, or, in extenuating circumstances, may send their request to the President and Secretary, who will then announce it to the House Membership. Voting on a new membership application shall take place at a House meeting within the next available calendar week following the application.}

\section{Mural Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Elin Stenmark
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    There currently exists no constitutional precedent for the process of altering House spaces by painting murals, including who gets to submit a Mural Proposal, how House Approval is sought, and who is deemed responsible for ensuring compliance with Caltech policy and communication with the appropriate stakeholders.

    The Mural process is a cooperative effort between the House and Caltech's Housing Office, and is governed by Caltech policy. Therefore, this amendment seeks to clarify and codify our internal Mural Proposal process while leaving enough flexibility to adapt to new Caltech policy without having to update the constitution in the event that Caltech policy changes.
    
    Any Venerable House member can become a Project Leader, given that Full Members vote on any proposed mural. Quorum and voting seeks to mirror that of House meetings for Full Membership applications.
    
    Given the asynchronous voting period, in the event that a major grievance is identified, by posting the grievances, all members become aware of the alleged issue and are able to vote again with this information in mind. By limiting the instances of voicing grievances to one posting of grievances, we ensure that the proposed mural is not maliciously prevented from being enacted given that it receives enough votes for House Approval. %TODO update probably?

    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        1.3 Duties and Privileges \\
        1. The duties and privileges of Full Members apply immediately upon attaining such status.
        These duties and privileges are:

            \item to abide by the rules and regulations made by the Executive Committee, the Upper Class Committee, and the Committee on Student Houses.
        \end{enumerate}
        2. The duties and privileges of Social Members apply immediately upon ratification by The House and are identical to Full Members, with the exception of:

        \color{ForestGreen} B Mural Amendment
        
        The designated artist lead, hereby ``Project Leader'', is to notify the President of intent to paint a mural. The Project Leader will be asked to submit a Mural Proposal to the President, containing a mockup design and other pertinent details as specified by the President. If policy violations are identified, the Project Leader will be asked to revise their submission. The Diversity Representative shall be consulted to confirm that the mural is absent of offensive depictions.
        
        The President will distribute the submitted material to Full Members. In the 48 hours following distribution of the Proposal, comments (including major grievances) are gathered from Full Members. The comments shall be posted immediately following this period. A 72-hour voting period ensues, after which the mural receives House Approval if it receives a 2/3 majority of non-abstain votes with at least 50\% of the members present voting ``Yes'', when those voting constitute at least 1/3 of the Full Membership of the House.
        
        A Mural Proposal must receive House Approval before being submitted to Caltech's Housing Office. The Project Leader and President jointly assume responsibility for ensuring that the mural complies with all regulations established by Caltech's Housing Office. Further, the President is responsible for submitting the Mural Proposal to Caltech's Housing Office following House Approval.

\section{Election Committee Appointment Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Joe Giambrone
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Currently, the procedure regarding the actual appointment the Election Committee is not specified. This amendment ensures that it is appointed by the President and the Head Upper Class Committee-member, and clarifies what happens if the President is running.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        A Procedural Amendment \\
        An Election Committee shall be appointed at the nomination meeting. The Election Committee shall be composed of nine Full House Members: 3 sophomores, 3 juniors, and 3 seniors or above, who shall be selected from a pool of volunteers who are not running for an elected office. In the event that too few members of a specific class volunteer, the remaining members shall be drawn from the other classes.

\end{itemize}


\section{Soc/Ath Team Voting Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:}
    
    This amendment clarifies how Social and Athletic team elections are run.

    In the past, full members were allowed to run individually or in a team with other members. This caused two issues. First, individuals were put at a disadvantage if they did not have running mates but had to run against a team of candidates. Secondly, there is currently no mathematical method specified as to how a winner is chosen under an election where both individuals and teams can run. This amendment serves to fix both of those problems.

    To standardize all multi-winner election procedures, the upperclass BoC election process has been modified to be in line with the new Social and Athletic team election procedures. The single transferable vote method\footnote{A more detailed explanation can be found here: \href{https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI}{https://youtu.be/l8XOZJkozfI}} (Droop quota variation\footnote{\href{https://youtu.be/wRc630BSTIg}{https://youtu.be/wRc630BSTIg}}) was chosen as it is generally regarded as the most fair multi-winner electoral system and is commonly used in parliamentary elections around the world.
    \item \textbf{Current Language:}
    
    A Procedural Amendment

    Paper ballots shall be cast anonymously at a House Meeting held for that purpose. The Election Committee shall be responsible for collecting and tabulating ballots. The winner of each election, other than for the BoC representatives, shall be determined as follows: all candidates that do not achieve a majority over ``NO'' are eliminated, and the ranked pairs (Tideman) method is applied to the remaining candidates. The Election Committee shall be responsible for breaking any ties that occur during this process.
    
    For the election of the BoC representatives, each voter may cast two first choice votes and rank their replacements in the case that one of their first choices is eliminated. Votes shall be counted via elimination of the candidate with the lowest number of first choice votes until two candidates receive over 1/3 of the votes each.
    
    \item \textbf{Proposed Language:}
    
    A Procedural Amendment

    \add{For positions where multiple individuals are elected, candidates must run individually. All candidates that do not achieve a majority over ``NO'' are eliminated, and the single transferable vote method is applied using the Droop quota.}

\section{UCC Eligibility Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} The constitution currently does not allow transfer students to apply to become UCCs until their second year at Caltech, even if they were to be juniors or seniors during their term in office. This amendment serves to expand UCC application eligibility for that scenario.
    
    \item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
        2.3 Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
        1. One Upper Class Committee-member shall reside in each Venerable House Alley and two shall reside off-campus, except in the case where no suitable volunteers can be found living off-campus, in which case the Off-Campus Upper Class Committee-members may live on-campus. An Upper Class Committee-member shall have been both enrolled at Caltech for at least five academic terms and a Full House Member for at least three academic terms prior to their term of office. A Peer Advocate shall have been both enrolled at Caltech for at least five academic terms and a Full House Member for at least three academic terms prior to their term of office.

\section{Appointed Positions Current Practices Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Date Passed:}
    \item \textbf{Author:} Noah Howell and Joe Giambrone
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Clarified many aspects of appointed positions to align with current practices. There are no ``new'' additions; everything below has already been in effect for a while, sometimes years.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fixed title to match previous section on Elected Officers.
        \item Removed almost all mentions of Peer Advocates as they are no longer a House-appointed position, leading to confusion with UCCs.
        \item Replaced ``Diversity Council'' with a single ``Diversity Representative'' as there is only one of them, and updated the name of the Caltech Center for Inclusion and Diversity.
        \item Moved the selection of the Diversity Representative to be during the second round of appointed positions, to keep in line with recent practices.
        \item Updated the role of the Head UCC and Diversity Representative in the selection of appointed positions.
        \item Removed outdated duties of the Historians as they no longer make a scrapbook or maintain a House roll.
        \item Pluralized ``Head Waiters'' as there is more than one of them.
        \item Updated position names of BFD Editors, O'Domhnaills Representatives, IMSS Representatives, BoC Representatives, Head Waiters, and Historians to remove the preceding ``House(-elected)'' or otherwise fix.
        \item Added name and description of the BFD Advisor.
        \item Updated timeline for sign-ups and appointments.
        \item Removed amendment election tabulation from being a UCC responsibility to match recent practices.
        % \item Included requirement that officers with guaranteed rooms must be officers of Venerable House specifically (and not of another house).

\section{Off-Campus Rep Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 2/2/2024
	\item \textbf{Author:} Randy Ngo
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} Ever since Bechtel opened in Fall 2018, the importance of the Off-Campus Rep position has significantly reduced. To improve the functionality of Excomm without adjusting its size, this amendment proposes to replace the Off-Campus Rep position with a secondary Soc Man (Social Mini). \\
	Currently, Soc Man is one of the most demanding house positions due to its responsibility of organizing nearly all house events. By adding the Soc Mini position, it would alleviate some of the workload from the Soc Man, while improving continuity in the yearly transition between Social Teams. This Excomm structure of having multiple Social Managers has been well tested in all seven other houses. The current Off-Campus Rep role will be merged with the Soc Mini position, ensuring the voice of off-campus members remains represented on Excomm.

Nominations shall remain open until 36 hours before the start of the elections as described in section 2.4.2. \\
	2.4.2. Election of all officers except Social Team and Athletic Team shall be carried out at a House Meeting held for that purpose within one week after the nomination meeting. The order of election shall be in the following order: President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Librarian, Social Manager, Athletic Manager, Sophomore Representative, Off-Campus Representative, three BoC representatives, CRC representative, ARC representative. Elections shall be managed by an Election Committee in accordance with the Procedural Amendment (Amendment A). \\

The Social Team will be responsible for organizing social functions, and for publishing a calendar of such events. \\

\section{Food Representative Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The position of Food Representative is not currently in the constitution, this amendment both adds Food Rep to the constitution and makes it a part of the role of being Head Waiter. The Head Waiter is the person best suited to being Food Rep since they are present at most dinners and are best able to judge the house's response to meals.

\section{Election Amendment for Timeline Modifications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} \\
	This amendment fixes outdated language regarding the timing of elections. In the past, each position was nominated and elected before the next position could begin. Since we have moved to electing all positions at the same meeting, this text must also be removed in order to align the constitution to our current procedures. \\
	This amendment also adjusts the timeline for electing Soc Team and Ath Team. This ensures that a Soc Man and Ath Man will have been elected before voting on the team commences. Additionally, it extends the voting period to a week, as has been done in the past 2 years. \\
	This amendment also removes text about requiring a majority of votes since this is conflict with the Procedural Amendment. \\
	The Procedural Amendment also requires that ballots be submitted anonymously, thus it does change the procedure to remove the part about secret ballots.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.3. Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
	5. The Head Waiter shall be responsible for maintaining proper decorum and conduct in the dining room, and shall direct the student waiters.2.4 Nominations, Elections, and Appointments \\

Elections shall be managed by an Election Committee in accordance with the Procedural Amendment. \\
	3. Election for Social Team and Athletic Team shall be carried out through proxy voting beginning at the conclusion of the House Meeting described in section 2.4.2 and concluding 48 hours later. The elections shall be managed by the Election Committee.

\section{Records Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/26/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Elaine Lowinger
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} There is no current record of the amendments proposed that have modified the constitution. Therefore, many times when proposing new amendments or trying to determine intent of the constitution, knowledge of this document and the phrasing is lost in time. The goal of this is to log the change in the constitution in an accessible form to the house to understand the changes made. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} None
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{
	8.4 Records \\
	If a proposed amendment is passed, the Constitution is modified to match the amended language. In addition, the proposal for the amendment shall be added to the “Amendment History” document. This includes the date of the amendment's approval, the proposer of the amendment, the reasoning of the amendment, the unamended language, and the approved amended language. The Amendment History document shall be accessible to all Full Members of the House.}

\section{IMSS Representative Amendment}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 4/11/2020
	\item \textbf{Author:} Chase Blanchette
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The duties of the House IMSS reps are currently not codified in the constitution, and no roles for upkeep of specific House technology (3D printer(s), printers) are assigned, which could lead to a lack of accountability. This amendment outline the responsibilities of the IMSS reps and proposes individual roles among the IMSS reps to ensure accountability. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} None
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\
	2.3 Duties and Qualifications of Appointed Officers \\
	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{

\section{Abstain Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 5/21/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Elaine Lowinger and Sierra Lopezalles
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The current issues with House Memberships, as explained by the UCCs reviewing the constitution, is that there is no distinction between voting No and abstaining from voting, as the wording says “only 2/3 majority of those voting”. To allow a voice to people in the house who would like to be present at meetings and vote, but not comfortable making a firm decision, we want to give them the option to abstain. To do so, we have changed the wording of the constitution. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	1.2 Membership \\
	1. The types and qualifications of membership are: \\
	(a) a Full Member, who is an undergraduate of the California Institute of Technology and is picked as such at the end of Rotation Week, or is elected as such by a 2/3 majority of those voting at a House meeting. 
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} \\

\section{Room Occupancy Priority Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 3/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Emily Wu
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} Room Hassle and the time leading up to it can be very stressful for Rudds who want to live in the house, especially for those without a position that has a room pick. In order to maximize the number of members that can live in the house and reduce this stress, I am making it explicit that Rudds opting for singles get least priority during Room Hassle, and clarifying some of the other language regarding room occupancy priority.  
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	7.1.4. Rooms, with the exception of a designated sophomore off-campus alley, shall be picked in the following order: 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\section{Bechtel Freshmen Room Hassle Priority Amendment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 3/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Emily Wu
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} This amendment is intended to address the case of freshmen who lived in Bechtel their first year, but would like to have the opportunity to live in the house their sophomore year in years where Room Hassle is competitive.

\section{Gender Neutral Wording}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Emily Wu and Erik Herrera
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:} The current version of the constitution uses only ‘He/him/his' pronouns. We would like to use more inclusive language. This would benefit current Ruddock House members and all the classes to come. 
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} Numerous instances. The change will apply to the entire constitution.
	\item \textbf{Proposed Language:} Change everywhere the constitution uses male-centered language to gender-neutral language. Examples include \textcolor{red}{he/him/his} to genderless pronouns (\textcolor{ForestGreen}{they/them}) or avoid pronoun use, Committee\textcolor{red}{man} to Committee\textcolor{ForestGreen}{-member}, and fresh\textcolor{red}{man} to \textcolor{ForestGreen}{frosh}.

\section{Splitting Steward Role Between Veep and Treasurer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Date Passed:} 1/19/2019
	\item \textbf{Author:} Rupesh Jeyaram
	\item \textbf{Reasoning:}  As of now, Veep can assume more House responsibilities. The lack of Veep duties results from the Veep/HUCC split two years ago. Treasurer already has a lot of responsibilities, and it would be nice to distribute work more evenly. Makes sense to shift responsibilities in this manner.
	\item \textbf{Current Language:} \\
	2.2 Qualifications and Duties of Elected Officers \\
	2. The Vice President shall be a junior or senior for the latter portion of his term in office. He shall assume the duties of the President in the event of the President's absence. He shall be responsible for maintaining the external relations of the House, for bringing guests to the House, and shall act as official host for all House guests. He shall be the Ruddock representative on the Review Committee. \\
	4. The Treasurer shall be responsible to the House for all receipts and expenditures, shall maintain an adequate book-keeping system, shall submit a report to the Executive Committee at each regularly scheduled meeting, shall propose a budget to the Executive Committee for each term, and shall submit to the House a written report of the finances at the end of each term.
